# linearRegressionMachineLearning
This machine learning algorithm is designed to learn how to draw the line of best given set of data points.


As a part of a programming assignment for an online machine learning course, the gradientDescent.m file contains the code for optimizing the parameters of the cost function so that it would be minimal, thus, yielding the best prediction outputs/results. In short, this file is the one responsible for the "learning" process.
